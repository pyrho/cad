* CST buttons
** Version 0.5
*** Observations
    It's fucked.. the front clip is not far enough, the side crosses are waaay off, 
    the button tower is not offseted....
*** Things to check
    - [X] Back clip fit
    - [X] Front clip fit
    - [X] How ergo are the side buttons ? Position is good ?
    - [X] Switch fit?
    - [X] Crosses fit ?
    - [X] Side Crosses distance ?
** Version 0.6
   Things to check:
     - button tower
     - crosses fit/pos
     - front/back clips
*** Fixes [6/6]
**** DONE Buttons position

     Angle is too large, 10deg less would feel better
**** DONE Switches fit

     Take measures from thingiverse model and compare with mine
**** DONE Tower position
     CLOSED: [2019-06-12 Wed 02:26]
     Currently centered on the small arm. Should be offseted.
     Find a way to center a new shape built from difference at origin.
     Maybe export as STL and import again ? That sucks but I'm not sure how to do it otherwise..
     Also make the switch holes before rotating the angled face.
**** DONE Front clip

     Front clip not reaching far enough
     Did not account for the width of the back clip.
     Moving the upwards arms after the end of the X axis skeleton
     arm should solve the issue, because the X axis seems to have
     perfect measures.
     This fixes the front clip too, same issue.
**** DONE Back clip
     CLOSED: [2019-06-11 Tue 01:34]
**** DONE Sides crosses too far from holes

** Version 0.7
*** Things to fix
**** DONE Supports fucked
     CLOSED: [2019-06-13 Thu 01:20]
     - Could not test back clip as it broke with the support
     - Switches mount supports did not come off either..
     + Print with the tower flat
**** +TODO Front clip is maybe 1mm too close to edge+
     I think it's because the top cross doesnt fit.
**** DONE Side crosses are fucked still

     A fix could be to have seperate offsets
**** +TODO Make switch holes 1mm bigger (so 0.5 on each side)+
     I think the size is good, it's just that the print was fucked on the holes.
     But with a fixed print it should fit perfectly.
**** DONE Button tower is 0.3mm too high from the skeleton
     CLOSED: [2019-06-14 Fri 01:36]
**** DONE Buttons collide with each other with the keycaps on
     CLOSED: [2019-06-14 Fri 01:58]
**** DONE side crosses a bit shallower
     CLOSED: [2019-06-14 Fri 01:28]
**** DONE front cross still does not fit in.., make it narrower

** Version 0.8
*** Things to fix
**** DONE Front clip floating in void..
     CLOSED: [2019-06-15 Sat 16:30]
**** TODO Top button too far
     Top button pos would be ok at current low button pos 
**** TODO top cross doesnt go in
**** TODO sides crosses do not fit
*** Ideas     
**** Use the file from thingiverse to model the curve
