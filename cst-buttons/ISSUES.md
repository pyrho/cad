Issues
======

v0.1 issues
-----------
* [x] y arm is too high (too much towards the top of the trackball)
* [x] side crosses are a bit too far apart, can't get them both to fit the holes
* [x] bottom clearance is a tad too high
* [x] the crosses could be a bit larger, the fit is quite loose
* [x] the side crosses are maybe a bit too deep 
      This could be fixed by making the center hollow
* [x] The top cross could be a bit deeper

v0.2 issues
-----------
* [x] side cross still a bit too far apart, but really a bit.
* [x] refine fillet for upwards arm
* [x] upwards arm hits bezel on side of mouse

v0.3 issues
-----------
* [x] cross hole is way too small
* [x] back-clip angle too steep
* [x] side crosses maybe 0.1mm far apart

0.4 issues
----------
- [x] sides crosses too flimsy
      The only way is to have a very flat cross
- [x] side cross still too far apart, maybe just 0.2mm
- [ ] back clip maybe 0.1 mm too far from back of trackball
- [ ] top cross maybe too deep, does not fit in properly, maybe something hidden
      is blocking it
