#+TITLE: Notes

* Version issues
** 0.0.1 issues [4/4]
*** DONE Connector hole is to narrow
    It should also take into account the fact that the connector is angled.
*** DONE Cannot fit dock inside
    Printing with supports under the dock shell is a bad idea
*** DONE iPhone holder too big
    Like almost x2 too big...
*** DONE Very tight fit for the dock
      Maybe add a millimeter
** 0.0.2 issues [6/6]
*** DONE guide & hole too far behind
*** DONE iphone sits too high
    the charging does not happen because the connector is not going deep enough.
    Make a hole along the x axis.

*** +Give it 2mm more on the side of the guide+
    See below, thickness was fucked

    The thickness needed to be added .
