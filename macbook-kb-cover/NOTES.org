#+TITLE: Notes

* 0.0.1 issues
** TODO Key gaps too big
   2 is too much, maybe 1 should be better
** TODO Layer is thin
   It may be due to the incorrect gaps, but it's way too easy to activate
   a switch right now.
   Given that the amount of force required to trigger a key is very small,
   maybe an air gap between the cover and the key is necessary..
** TODO Print was mirror in slicer....
   Rotate the model manually, I initially just mirrored it on cura, so the
   test print was unusable...
** TODO Do not use a brim
   Use a skirt instead.
** TODO Try printing in PLA
   ABS is more flexible
